## Task 31
  Assuming we are using a CPython implementation of Python3 with default options/configuration: How many int objects are created by the execution of the first line of the script? (103-line1.txt). How many int objects are created by the execution of the second line of the script (103-line2.txt)
## Task 32
  Assuming we are using a CPython implementation of Python3 with default options/configuration: How many int objects are created by the execution of the first line of the script? (104-line1.txt). How many int objects are created by the execution of the second line of the script (104-line2.txt). After the execution of line 3, is the int object pointed by a deleted? Answer with Yes or No (104-line3.txt). After the execution of line 4, is the int object pointed by b deleted? Answer with Yes or No (104-line4.txt). How many int objects are created by the execution of the last line of the script (104-line5.txt).
## Task 33
  Assuming we are using a CPython implementation of Python3 with default options/configuration: Before the execution of line 2 (print("Love")), how many int objects have been created and are still in memory? (105-line1.txt). Why? (optional blog post :))
## Task 34
  Assuming we are using a CPython implementation of Python3 with default options/configuration (For answers with numbers use integers, t spell out the word): How many string objects are created by the execution of the first line of the script? (106-line1.txt). How many string objects are created by the execution of the second line of the script (106-line2.txt). After the execution of line 3, is the string object pointed by a deleted? Answer with Yes or No (106-line3.txt). After the execution of line 4, is the string object pointed by b deleted? Answer with Yes or No (106-line4.txt). How many string objects are created by the execution of the last line of the script (106-line5.txt).
